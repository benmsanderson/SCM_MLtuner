Machine learning tuning for Simple Climate Models

Demonstration using FaIR

LHC ensemble produces 20,000 member LHC ensemble
EEI network fits neural network, simulates a 100 million member ensemble and selects high performing subset of 1000 members for a range of constraints
post-ensemble creates iterative solutions for 1.5 stablisation and assesses remaining carbon budget
